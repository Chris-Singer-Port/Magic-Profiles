# Magic-Profiles
This will be a multiple page website designed to show my friends and their Magic Bios. 

This css is not very clean. The height and size of the divs will be changed to percentages in the future. 

My goal of this project is to keep getting used to basic html, div control, cascading css proporties, creating my own "images",
fitting pictures into divs, and creating linking pages with a home page.
